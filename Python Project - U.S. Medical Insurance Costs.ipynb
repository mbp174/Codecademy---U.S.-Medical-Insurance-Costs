    "For this project, you will be investigating a medical insurance costs dataset in a .csv file using the Python skills that you have developed. This dataset and its parameters will seem familiar if you have done any of the previous Python projects in the data science path.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, you are now tasked with working with the actual information in the dataset and performing your own independent analysis on real-world data! We will not be providing step-by-step instructions on what to do, but we will provide you with a framework to structure your exploration and analysis.\n",
